# Comp472_Project

Our goal is to train a CNN with the ability to classify different types of masks in images.

## The Team (NS_04)
- Maxime Johnson (Compliance Specialist)
- Visweshwaran Balasubramanian (Training Specialist)
- Matthew Greco (Evaluation Specialist)
- Hayden Ross (Data Specialist)

## File Descriptions:
- <b>MaskDetection.ipynb:</b> Final combined jupyter notebook responsible for handling the preprocessing, training, and evaluation of our model.
- <b>Dataset:</b> All of our images organised by class into subfolders.

## Execution
1. Download `MaskDetection.ipynb` and the `Dataset`. Make sure that the `Dataset` is in the execution directory of `MaskDetection.ipynb`.
2. Make sure the following libraries are installed: tensorflow, torch, torchvision, sklearn, itertools, matplotlib, and numpy.
3. Run the notebook. Sections area labelled so you don't need to re-run the everything at each test / execution. Running on the GPU this step took approximately 3 minutes.
